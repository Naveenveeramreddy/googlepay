# googlepay
This Python code simulates a G-Pay system with classes for User (details, PIN, accounts, history), BankAccount (bank info, balance), and Transaction (transfer details). The GpayController manages user signup, login, linking bank accounts, checking balances, deposits, transfers (self and others), and transaction history logging.
